# My Todo App
This is my own version of the simple [To-Do](http://todomvc.com/) app 📝. It was built using vanilla JavaScript ✨.

## Things I learned
The main purpose of creating this app was to practice and acquire new skills in vanilla javascript. This is a vague list of things I learned:
- Function composition
- Components that received props and returned HTML elements.
- Some design patterns such as publish/subscribe and factory functions.
- Vanilla state management using my very own pub/sub implementation.
- Testing and mocking with Jest.
- Component with dependencies that used the factory pattern to make them testable.

## How does it work?
### Install dependencies ⏳📉
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Run the local environment 🌎👩🏻‍💻

```bash
$ npm start
```
### Run the tests and watch 🔎📈

```bash
$ npm run test-dev
```
